Importer
=======================

In this test you are asked to build a simple application which imports data from one source and writes them into another.

In real work we are using lots of external libraries to speedup our work or share codebase between projects,
ability to putting them together in elegant way improves cooperation between coworkers and makes projects easy to
maintain. This test will challenge you to integrate few components in order to solve simple problem.

In `./tests` we have put `ApplicationTest.php` file which should be treated as specification.
Your job is to make sure that all of the tests in that file pass successfully.

# Notes

## Library mocks

In `./stubs` directory we have put some libraries which should be integrated with app.

# What you can do

- Write your code in `./src` directory.
- Modify composer.json if you need
- Fix any errors in given codebase.
- Share your code on Github
- Create build using Travis (https://travis-ci.org/) and share build status on README page  

# What you can not

- Modify any code in `./stubs` - treat this code as external libraries

## What will we grade

- Code architecture
- Use of design patterns
- Code style
- Clarity of the solution
- How code is tested

Good luck!
